Although, due to the existence of the uncertainty in robot’s movements which is a product of many factors (e.g. drifts, dead-reckoning, etc.), the robot needs a map (e.g. a set of recognizable landmarks) to correct its misalignments in coordination with the map.

The major issues are uncertainty, the correspondence also called data association, and time complexity
