Although, due to the existence of the uncertainty in robot’s movements which is a product of many factors (e.g. drifts, dead-reckoning, etc.), the robot needs a map (e.g. a set of recognizable landmarks) to correct its misalignments in coordination with the map.

Towards this goal, a robot must have the ability to create a map of the environment, localize itself on it, and control its own motion.

1) Identification of the potential actions: solely to reduce the computational burden, the first stage aims to deter-mine a reduced subset of possible actions to execute.
2) Utility computation: the expected cost and gain of per-forming each candidate action has to be estimated.
3) Action selection and execution: finally, the last stage involves finding and executing the optimal action(s).

STAGE 1: IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL ACTIONS
A. Representation of the Environment
four different types of map representations: topological, metric, metric-semantic, and hybrid maps.
B. Detecting Goal Locations
STAGE 2: UTILITY COMPUTATION
STAGE 3: ACTION SELECTION AND EXECUTION

The problem of mobile robot navigation has been historically faced by decomposing it in three sub-problems: environment mapping, ocalization and trajectory planning.

The concept of SLAM was initially presented at the IEEE Robotics and Automation Conference in 1986. Smith et al. proposed the application of the estimation theory-based method for the localization and mapping of robots, marking the integration of robotics with artificial intelligence. 

Currently, VSLAM methods can be broadly categorized into three classes: filter-based, optimization-based, and deep learning-based methods.

Similar to the classical SLAM system, VSLAM system consists of four primary components: the frontend, the backend, loop closure detection and mapping.
Backend optimization is essentially a state estimation problem, consisting of two methods: the filter method and the BA method.
Backend optimization can correct the maximum error of frontend results, but the cumulative error always exists. Loop closure detection can eliminate the influence of the cumulative error, which plays a significant role in system precision and the global consistency map.
The purpose of mapping is to simultaneously achieve self-localization and construct a map of the unknown environment. 

Visual odometry tracks and calculates two adjacent frames to obtain the camera pose, depth map and local consistent trajectory.
