Although, due to the existence of the uncertainty in robot’s movements which is a product of many factors (e.g. drifts, dead-reckoning, etc.), the robot needs a map (e.g. a set of recognizable landmarks) to correct its misalignments in coordination with the map.

The major issues are uncertainty, the correspondence also called data association, and time complexity

Towards this goal, a robot must have the ability to create a map of the environment, localize itself on it, and control its own motion.

1) Identification of the potential actions: solely to reduce the computational burden, the first stage aims to deter-mine a reduced subset of possible actions to execute.
2) Utility computation: the expected cost and gain of per-forming each candidate action has to be estimated.
3) Action selection and execution: finally, the last stage involves finding and executing the optimal action(s).

STAGE 1: IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL ACTIONS
A. Representation of the Environment
four different types of map representations: topological, metric, metric-semantic, and hybrid maps.
B. Detecting Goal Locations
STAGE 2: UTILITY COMPUTATION
STAGE 3: ACTION SELECTION AND EXECUTION

The problem of mobile robot navigation has been historically faced by decomposing it in three sub-problems: environment mapping, ocalization and trajectory planning.
